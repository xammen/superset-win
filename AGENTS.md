# Superset Monorepo

Superset is an agent-first development platform, with an Electron desktop IDE, Next.js web apps, and an Expo mobile app as the main customer-facing surfaces. It's a Turborepo monorepo, deployed apps are in apps/ and supporting packages are in packages/, and we use tRPC for the api.

You're working inside a Superset workspace, an isolated git-worktree copy of this repo. "Workspace" in a user message means that, not an editor workspace.

```

1. **One folder per component**: `ComponentName/ComponentName.tsx` + `index.ts` for barrel export
2. **Co-locate by usage**: If used once, nest under parent's `components/`. If used 2+ times, promote to **highest shared parent's** `components/` (or `components/` as last resort)
3. **One component per file**: No multi-component files
4. **Co-locate dependencies**: Utils, hooks, constants, config, tests, stories live next to the file using them

### Exception: shadcn/ui Components

The `src/components/ui/` and `src/components/ai-elements` directories contain shadcn/ui components. These use **kebab-case single files** (e.g., `button.tsx`, `base-node.tsx`) instead of the folder structure above. This is intentional—shadcn CLI expects this format for updates via `bunx shadcn@latest add`.

## Database

Drizzle ORM, schema in `packages/db/src/`. Follow `.agents/skills/db-migrations/SKILL.md` to generate
migrations. Never hand-edit `packages/db/drizzle/` (SQL, `meta/_journal.json`, snapshots) without
explicit user confirmation, and never apply migrations against a shared or production database.

## Releases

Desktop, host-service, and cli share one version; cut releases on a dedicated branch. Runbook:
`scripts/release/README.md`. A *canary* is a separate thing: `bash scripts/release-canary.sh
[commit]` builds the rolling internal `desktop-canary` prerelease, not a versioned release.

## Plugins

First-party plugins live in `plugins/<name>/`: a `plugin.json` manifest, `skills/`, and optionally
an MCP server. A release is the git tag `<name>@<version>` on this repo — that tree is what a host
downloads — and `packages/shared/src/plugins/manifests.generated.ts` is the bundle the API resolves
against, which is generated and must never be hand-edited. Change the source, then
`superset plugins publish <name> --bump patch`, which rewrites the marketplace entry in
`.agent-marketplace.json` and the generated manifests; commit and tag to publish it. `bun run check:plugins` is what CI
runs to catch a change that skipped that step; run it before pushing.

Installed plugins are recorded once per machine in
`$SUPERSET_HOME_DIR/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (`SUPERSET_HOME` is the CLI's install prefix and
means nothing here). Every provisioner reads that one file — the desktop at boot, `plugins sync`,
the host-service — because provisioning is declarative and reaps whatever is absent from the desired
set. A caller that passes its own list instead makes the last writer delete the others' skills.
Details: `docs/plugins.md`.

## Orchestrating agents and workspaces

When work wants a fresh isolated environment, a parallel agent, or a long-running job, reach for the
`superset` CLI instead of hand-rolling git worktrees or doing it all serially in this one. It's
already on `PATH` in Superset terminals, and we dogfood it.

Replace the capitalized placeholders before running these:

```bash
superset ws create --project PROJECT_ID --branch BRANCH --agent claude --prompt "..."
superset agents create --workspace WORKSPACE_ID --agent claude --prompt "..."
superset ws list
superset terminals read --workspace WORKSPACE_ID --terminal TERMINAL_ID
superset ws delete WORKSPACE_ID
```

In order: an isolated workspace with an agent already working in it, another agent in an existing
workspace, what's running, what an agent is doing right now, and cleanup when you're done.

Spawning several related workspaces? Add `--tag SOME_TAG` (repeatable) to `ws create` — tagged
workspaces group into a sidebar folder of that name automatically, so a batch files itself instead
of scattering across the project. `ws list --tag SOME_TAG` filters to them, and
`ws update WORKSPACE_ID --tag ...` retags (`--clear-tags` ungroups). Automation-created workspaces
are tagged `automation` by default and collect in an "automation" folder.

`superset <command> --help` covers the rest (tasks, automations, hosts, settings). Pass `--json` for
parsable output; it's on by default under agent environments.

## Internationalization

User-facing strings use Lingui macros with the English text as the message id —
`<Trans>Text</Trans>` or `useLingui()`'s `t({ message })` in React, `i18n._(msg({ message }))`
outside React (Electron main). Identical English with different meanings gets a `context`
so it translates separately. Numbers, currencies, and dates go through
`@superset/i18n/format` helpers, never `new Intl.*("en-US")` or `toLocale*` with a hardcoded
locale. After adding or changing strings, run `bun run check:i18n` (CI enforces it): it
regenerates the catalogs and lists every untranslated message per locale. Write those
translations yourself into each `locales/<locale>/messages.po` and commit the catalogs with
the change — nothing on CI fills translations for you. Conventions: `packages/i18n/README.md`;
terms that never translate: `packages/i18n/glossary.md`; strategy and phasing:
`plans/20260826-i18n-strategy.md`.
Directories listed in `packages/i18n/test/enforced-dirs.ts` must not contain hardcoded
JSX text — add a directory there once it is fully converted. `errorMessage()` output is potentially
translated and is display-only: logs, Sentry/PostHog, and error classification use
`rawErrorMessage()` or the error object (enforced by `packages/i18n/test/display-only.test.ts`).

**Shipping locales.** `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` in `packages/i18n/src/locales.ts` is the single
source of truth — adding a locale there is what makes it appear in the Settings picker and
the optional onboarding step, and what `lingui.config.ts` must list. Every enabled locale
must be **fully translated**: `compile --strict` fails the build on a missing message, so
finish a translation before adding its locale. Native language names live in `LOCALE_LABELS`
and are never translated — someone stuck in the wrong language has to recognize their own.
Relative times use `formatRelativeTime`/`formatCompactRelativeTime`, not hand-rolled
"3d ago" helpers; `Intl` already knows every locale's wording.

Three traps worth knowing before you touch catalogs:

- **Editing English copy re-keys the message.** The text is the id, so an edit creates a
  new entry that is empty in every locale and `check:i18n` lists it. If the edit was cosmetic,
  the old translations are still in `git diff` on the catalogs to copy from.
- **Regenerate from a clean tree.** `lingui.config.ts` keeps `messages.po` deterministic:
  `orderBy: "message"` fixes entry order, and `origins: false` drops the `#:` file
  references, whose order follows filesystem traversal and differs between macOS and
  Linux. A catalog regenerated on top of local experiments will still commit noise.
- **`bun test` runs uncompiled source.** The Lingui macro rewrites `` message: `${n} items` ``
  into a placeholder message plus values at build time, so the catalog stores `{n} items`.
  Tests see neither, which is why `apps/desktop/test-setup.ts` shims the macros and `i18n._`.
  Mock that module with a Proxy, never a spread — `i18n` is a class instance and a spread
  drops `load`/`activate`.

  app makes about a machine someone owns. Read it before touching sandboxes, and add to it when
  you find a new one.

  team — billing, credential blast radius, untested behaviour.
