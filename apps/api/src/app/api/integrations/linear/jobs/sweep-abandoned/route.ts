 * that can never be given up on, which is the one thing that counter exists to
 * prevent.

 * there first when they do — three of them is nine seconds at worst. This
 * bounds publishes that merely go slow, which is what actually runs a run out
 * of time and which that breaker never sees. Thirty seconds, plus at most one

/**

 *
 * The gap this closes: the webhook route answers Linear the moment a delivery
 * is durable, and everything after that is QStash's to retry. When QStash
 * exhausts its retries the message goes to its dead-letter queue and the row
 * stays `pending` or `failed` with nothing left to pick it up. Linear's own
 * redeliveries stop after six hours. Without this the delivery is durable,
 * queryable and permanently unprocessed.
 *
 * **Why it reads a time band rather than a status.** The obvious query — Linear
 * rows that are `pending` or `failed` — measured at 48.7s on production-shaped
 * data, walking 130k rows and dirtying 311k buffers, and it gets worse as the
 * backlog grows: a job that costs more than its cadence is exactly what #7114
 * had to stop happening. `webhook_events` is 137M rows and 101 GB, so the
 * partial index that would make a status query cheap needs a lock the ingest
 * path cannot afford. What the table does have is an index on `received_at`,
 * and a band of it is a bounded amount of work whatever the backlog looks
 * like: 22.7k rows and 539ms for fifteen minutes of ingest, and it stays that
 * whether there are no abandoned deliveries or ten thousand.
 *
 * The band is read inside `AS MATERIALIZED` on purpose. Without the fence the
 * planner has three ways to answer this and picks a different one depending on
 * how the bounds are written and what the statistics look like that day — one
 * of them being the 48.7s scan. The fence makes `received_at` the only usable
 * predicate, so the cost is the band and nothing else, permanently.
