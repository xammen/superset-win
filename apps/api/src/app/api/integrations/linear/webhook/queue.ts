 * organization can be connected to many Superset organizations, and the route
 * used to do every one of their task-mirror and automation writes inline: 17
 * connections meant ~100 database queries per delivery, ~40 of them at once,
 * which is what exhausts Neon's per-compute connect permits during a bulk
 * edit (Sentry API-18) and what put p95 at 15.7s — past Linear's own timeout.
 *
 * So the route now does only what proves the delivery is Linear's, records it,
 * and hands the fan-out to QStash; `jobs/process-delivery` does the rest with
 * retries and no clock over its head.
