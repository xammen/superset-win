 * already exists, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING returns no rows, and returning from
 * the insert would tell the caller the delivery failed when it did not.
 *
 * Dedup stays on (provider, event_id) exactly as before, which is only possible

 * partitioned table must include the partition key, and a redelivery arrives
 * with a different received_at, so it would no longer conflict.
