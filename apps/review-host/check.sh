# Outside-in check on the App Store review host. Run from a clone, with gcloud
# authenticated. Exits non-zero with a reason if a reviewer would have a bad time.
#
# The in-box timer keeps the version current and the in-box watchdog restarts a
# host the relay cannot see, but neither can report a box that is wedged, deleted
# or unreachable — that is what this is for.
#
# The interesting check is the last one. It derives the host procedures the
# mobile app actually calls from the working tree, then probes each against the
# live box. That is what would have caught 2026-08-17, when the app started
# calling github.getPullRequestDetail and the box silently 404'd it for three
# weeks: the version floor never noticed, because 1.22.0 still cleared 1.21.0.
