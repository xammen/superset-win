# Demo repositories the reviewer browses.

# acme is a CLONE of the public superset-sh/acme-demo, and that matters: its open
# PR #1 is what puts the pull-request chip on a workspace, and the chip is the
# only route to the diff the store listing promises. A `git init` here instead of
# a clone leaves no origin, no refs/remotes/origin/HEAD, and therefore no diff
# base and no PR — which is exactly what happened once.
#
# The guard is on the remote URL, not on .git: a host provisioned by the earlier
# version already has /demo/acme-ios/.git from a `git init`, and a presence check
# would leave that fabricated repo in place forever — no origin, no PR, exactly
# the state this replaced.

# Host identity. getHostId() is HMAC(salt, contents of /etc/machine-id), and on
# the Fly image that file was EMPTY — the ubuntu base never populates it and
# nothing there runs systemd — so this host's id is the HMAC of the empty
# string, a5b47dedad57a63d234ffff6753c74df. Reproducing it needs an empty file.
#
# We cannot just blank /etc/machine-id: systemd treats an empty one as first
# boot and repopulates it, which would silently change the id on the next reboot
# and register a second host the reviewer sees as a duplicate. So the OS keeps a
# real machine-id and only host-service is shown an empty one, via BindReadOnlyPaths.
