/// Dictation, run entirely on this side of the bridge.
///
/// This began as a prop mirror of React Native's `useVoiceDictation`. The level
/// meter is what settled it: the recogniser's volume had to cross the bridge
/// about ten times a second, for the whole recording, purely to animate five
/// dots — precisely the chatty seam this rewrite exists to remove. And
/// `expo-speech-recognition` is itself a wrapper over `SFSpeechRecognizer`, so
/// owning it here is less indirection rather than more.
///
/// The behaviours below are carried over deliberately from that hook; they were
/// each learned the hard way and none of them are obvious:
///
/// - **Continuous, final results only.** Interim results arrive constantly and
///   would rewrite the draft mid-sentence.
/// - **A finalize backstop.** Stopping asks the recogniser to flush; if it never
///   answers, the composer would sit in `finalizing` forever.
/// - **The recogniser's own task end is authoritative.** No result can follow
///   it, in any state.
/// - **Append, never replace**, so dictating after typing adds to what is there.
/// - **Permission refusal settles to idle** with the prior text intact.
