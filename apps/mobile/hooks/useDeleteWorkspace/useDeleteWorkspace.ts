 * host-service archives the row *before* any slow work, and that archive is
 * the commit point, so the 10-20s a teardown script and a worktree removal
 * take are all spent after the delete is already decided. Worse, past the
 * relay's 30s exchange cap the client is handed `BAD_GATEWAY: Request timed
 * out` for a delete that committed.
 *
 * The confirm is the whole gate. `force` goes out with every destroy rather
 * than preflighting for uncommitted work first: on a phone the answer to
 * "this worktree is dirty" is yes anyway — agent work is cheap to redo — and
 * a second alert after a refused destroy costs more than it protects.
 * Teardown still runs; `force` is git consent only.
 *
 * `onConfirmed` fires at that commit point, so a caller showing the workspace
 * can leave for the list instead of sitting on a screen whose row is gone.
