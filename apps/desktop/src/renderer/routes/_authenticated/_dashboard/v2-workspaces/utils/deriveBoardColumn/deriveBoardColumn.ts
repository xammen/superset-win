 *   3. live PR merged                    → Merged
 *   4. agent permission/failed           → Needs attention
 *   5. agent working                     → Working
 *   6. PR open/draft/queued              → Needs review
 *   7. agent review on a main/worktree   → Needs review
 *   8. otherwise                         → Idle
 *
 * A finished agent alone counts as review-worthy on main and worktree
 * workspaces: both are project checkouts a person is driving, and the
 * sidebar, dock badge and "Ready for review" filter already treat them that
 * way. Only session workspaces (automation and chat runs with no project
 * checkout) are excluded: they arrive in volume, and routing them to
 * "review" buries the real candidates (the bucket answers "what needs me").
