 * What the user sees when localStorage is full and reclaiming orphaned

 * instead of throwing is what stops the freeze (see `withQuotaGuard`). This
 * only decides how loudly to say so, which is a product call rather than a
 * correctness one, so the modes are kept side by side and selected by
 * `QUOTA_NOTICE_MODE`:
 *
 * - `silent`: console only, matching how `terminal-runtime-registry` already
 *   handles the same error. Quietest, but the user later finds their layout
 *   reverted with no explanation.
 * - `notify`: also raises a toast. Explains the reverted layout, but offers
 *   nothing to act on.
 * - `offer-reclaim`: adds an action that clears parked terminals' scrollback.
 *   The only option that can actually free space, and the only one that costs
 *   the user something visible.
