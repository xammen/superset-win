 * by the native rebuild alongside pty.node, so it is resolved the way node-pty
 * resolves it and the plain spawn is kept for a tree without the build.
 *
 * Two properties of the helper this relies on, both checked on macOS:
 * - Before exec it runs `close(open(ttyname(STDIN_FILENO), O_RDWR))` to attach
 *   a pty's controlling terminal. The spawn below gives it /dev/null as stdin,
 *   for which ttyname() returns NULL (ENOTTY), and open(NULL) fails with
 *   EFAULT instead of faulting, so the step is inert. It could only act if
 *   stdin were a terminal, and even then this spawn creates no new session,
 *   so the terminal would not be acquired.
 * - A failed execvp exits 1, so a helper that cannot run electron surfaces
 *   through handleChildExit as a nonzero exit rather than silently; the plain
 *   spawn fallback only needs to cover the helper not being built.
