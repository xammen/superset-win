/**
 * Arm for the activation-drip A/B. `getFeatureFlag` emits the
 * `$feature_flag_called` exposure PostHog scores the experiment on, so a user
 * enters the analysis only when this call succeeds.
 *
 * The flag must be MULTIVARIATE with variants keyed exactly `control` and
 * `test`. Only `control` withholds the drip; a missing, disabled or boolean
 * flag reads as `test`, so shipping this before the flag exists changes
 * nothing — everyone keeps getting the campaign until someone creates the
 * flag at 50/50.
 *
 * Fails OPEN for the same reason: the drip is what ships to everyone today, so
 * a PostHog outage must not silently stop it. Those signups emit no exposure
 * either, which keeps them out of both arms instead of polluting control.
