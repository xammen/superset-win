/**
 * Attributes a Stripe outcome to the user who started it, so it lands on the

 * The desktop app identifies with the Better Auth user id, and Better Auth
 * stamps that same id into Stripe metadata — so no id mapping is needed.
 *
 * Organizations subscribed outside the app (a Stripe-side action, an enterprise
 * deal closed by hand) carry no initiator. The owner is the closest honest
 * answer there, and `attribution` records which one we used so a funnel built on
 * these events can tell measured conversions from inferred ones.
 *
 * Safe to run twice: Stripe retries a webhook whenever the handler fails or
 * times out, and this one does enough before reaching here (emails, QStash) to
 * make that a real possibility rather than a theoretical one. Without the
 * de-duplication below, a retry would bill `payment_succeeded` twice.
 *
 * Never throws: a webhook must not fail because analytics did.
