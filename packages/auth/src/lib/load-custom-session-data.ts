 * organization's subscription, then the user's own row. Neon speaks HTTP, so
 * each call is its own request, and with the database in a different region to
 * the functions that was ~220ms on every authenticated request in the product.
 * Only the active-organization fallback made the order matter, and that is
 * expressible in SQL, so the three collapse into one statement.
 *
 * Raw SQL rather than drizzle's query builder because the point is the single
 * statement; expressing the fallback across three builder calls is what we are
