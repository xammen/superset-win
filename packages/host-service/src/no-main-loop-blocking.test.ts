// Ratchet: keeps blocking work off the host-service event loop. One slow
// in-process git spawn (or a sync fs walk) head-of-line blocks every tRPC
// response this process serves. Git subprocess work belongs in the worker
// pool (src/workers/) — see workers/tasks/git.ts for the pattern.
//
// Counts are per-file matching-line counts, not a file allowlist, so an
// already-listed file cannot silently grow new call sites. Patterns match
// bare identifiers (not just calls) so renamed imports and passed-around
// references count too. Two failure modes, both intentional:
//  - a file exceeds its count → new blocking call site; route it through
//    the worker pool (or async fs) instead of bumping the number.
//  - a file drops below its count → it was partially or fully fixed;
//    LOWER or DELETE its entry so the ratchet only ever tightens.
