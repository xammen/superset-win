 * a profile `read` steals the leading byte(s) (#3941/#5712), and reedline
 * (nushell) flushes ALL pending typeahead when it enables raw mode after
 * init — the command vanishes with an intact-looking kernel echo (#6024).
 *
 * So: wait for the startup output to go quiet (a shell at prompt is quiet; a
 * banner-printing one isn't), type, then verify the echo. Quiescence can't
 * see a silent `read -t` window — the echo mangle signature catches that —
 * and the echo can't distinguish kernel echo from editor echo — the
 * unexpected-tail rule (output after the echo that isn't the command's own
 * continuation) catches the flush class. Failures re-quiesce before the
 * Ctrl-U retype so the retry lands on the now-live editor instead of inside
 * the same init storm. The accept path requires a full Enter-delay of
 * post-echo quiet, which already provides the text→Enter separation, so
 * Enter goes out immediately on acceptance. After the retry budget the
 * command falls back to a blind Enter, exactly like the gated paths.
 *
 * A null `probe` (command too short or non-ASCII start — commandEchoProbe)
 * only disables the echo verification: the quiescence wait still applies, so
 * short commands like `ls` don't regress into the blind-write reedline-flush
 * loss (#6024). Those launches type once and send the delayed Enter.
