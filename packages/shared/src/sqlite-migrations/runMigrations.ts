/**
 * Applies every migration this database has not recorded yet.
 *
 * Drizzle's own migrator picks what to run by comparing each migration's
 * journal `when` against the single highest `created_at` in
 * `__drizzle_migrations`. That is a watermark, not a set, and it only moves
 * forward: a migration that arrives carrying a `when` below the watermark is
 * skipped, and stays skipped through every later upgrade. `when` records when
 * drizzle-kit generated the file, not the order files merged, so a machine
 * takes on a too-high watermark by running any build whose migration was
 * generated after — but shipped before — one still in flight elsewhere.
 * Branch and canary builds do that routinely.
 *
 * Keying on the set of recorded `created_at` values closes the hole and heals
 * databases that already lost a migration, whose `when` is simply absent from
 * the set. `created_at` is that same journal `when`, which drizzle has always
 * recorded, so this reads tables written by every previous version and writes
 * rows those versions still understand.
 *
 * It keys on `created_at` rather than `hash` deliberately: some migrations
 * were edited after they had already shipped (the desktop's local-db has six),
 * so the hashes those machines recorded no longer match the files on disk, and
 * hashing would re-run migrations that are already applied.
