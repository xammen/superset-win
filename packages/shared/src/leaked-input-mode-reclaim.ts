/**
 * Reclaiming TUI-only input-reporting modes leaked into a live shell prompt (#4949).
 *
 * A TUI (mastracode/pi-tui, Claude Code) arms the kitty keyboard protocol / mouse
 * tracking / focus reporting and disarms them on clean exit. Killed uncleanly
 * (SIGKILL, crash) it never writes the restore sequences, so the shell that
 * reclaims the pty inherits them: every keystroke is CSI-u encoded (Ctrl+C ->
 * `^[[99;5u`), mouse moves spray reports, and the terminal is unusable until
 * `reset`.
 *
 * This module owns only the decision logic — a shell-owned epoch (modes armed
 * before the first prompt marker belong to shell init and are never reclaimed)
 * and a mark-then-recheck flush (a mode re-armed before the flush keeps its
 * state). It is transport-agnostic so any surface that can observe the terminal
 * stream can reuse it: the renderer xterm parser today (see
 * renderer/lib/terminal/terminalInputModeReclaimer.ts), a host-side VT scanner
 * later.
